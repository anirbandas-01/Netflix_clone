# Netflix Clone  
A front-end clone of Netflix built with React + Vite.

## 🚀 Project Overview

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- React (JavaScript)  
- Vite (fast build tooling)  
- CSS / SCSS (or whatever styling you used)  
- ESLint (for code quality)  
- [Any other libs you used: e.g., React Router, Axios, etc.]

## 🎯 Key Features  
- Homepage layout with hero banner, rows of show cards  
- Responsive design (desktop + mobile)  
- Hover effects / card interactions  
- (If applicable) Using a public API or dummy data for movie/show listings  
- Clean folder structure: `src/`, `public/`, assets, etc.
